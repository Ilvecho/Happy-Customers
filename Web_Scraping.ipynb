            "<p>An HR compliance checklist is important for the proper functioning of an organization. HR compliance is defined as the responsibility of the business to abide by and follow the working standards set out by the employment facility.

            "<p>These operational standards set up by employment law may affect the system, policies, and documentation, so the officers need to follow a proactive approach to ensure that the system meets all of its legal obligations.</p>\n",

            "Employee Handbook\n",
            "<p>Substantial compliance can be ensured by providing an employee handbook and regularly updating it.
